A collaborative project to document container-based application architecture, creation and management.  The built version of this source can be viewed at http://docs.projectatomic.io/container-best-practices/


== Compile Asciidoc to HTML

We are using a container to compile Asciidoc to HTML, using `sudo docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/documents/:Z asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor make html` will create a file called README.html

=== Spell check

`aspell` is used to spell check the document. This is run in a [Travis job](https://travis-ci.org/projectatomic/container-best-practices) for all pull requests. Any non-English words should be added to `containers.dict` with your commit. Ensure `make check` passes.

=== Clean up files

```
make clean
```

This removes all generated files.

== Publish to github

Github serves HTML documents from the `gh-pages` branch. This command will push to the branch.

```
make publish
```
