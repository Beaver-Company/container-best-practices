=== Persistent Storage: Simple Database Server

Although transience is the main benefit of containers, being able to preserve data after a container terminates is often an essential requirement for production environments. Below are outlined common complications the user can encounter and possible solutions.  

==== Traditional database server

One of the simpler environments in the IT world is a database that serves one or more
client nodes.  A corporate directory is an example most of us can identify with.  Consider
the figure below.

In this scenario, we have a single server running a Linux distribution.  The server functions
largely as a database server (perhaps postgres) for other clients that can connect to it on
the network.  The database is capable of connecting to the clients on the network using the
standard TCP/IP network stack and typically a combination of TCP socket and port.  In the case
of posgres, the default port is 5432.

More importantly, many database implementations store the database files on reliable, enterprise
storage such as SANs or robust RAID arrays.  This is done to obviously protect the database
from data loss. By default, containers have immutable storage; and therefore, if the container
is deleted, your data will be lost. As a developer, you will need to understand and design
your containerization in a way that will allow for data to persist regardless of the state
of the container.


==== Containerized Environment

In the case of a database server, retaining your data can be critical.  The default storage for
containers themselves is not persistent but it can be with a little planning.  The most common
way to allow for data persistence is using one of the xref:planning_storage[several methods]
already available to docker or your chosen deployment platform.  The following figure is a simplified
containerized topography of the same database from above.

Note how the container host, like the traditional Linux deployment, has enterprise storage
associated with it.  Through the use of link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/[docker volumes],
we can assign storage to containers and those volumes will persist irregardless of the
state of the container.
