== Dockerfile Location

Upstream Dockerfiles should be hosted in a public GIT repository, for example https://github.com[GitHub]. Ideally, the repository should be created under the organization relevant to a particular project. For example, http://www.softwarecollections.org[Software Collections] Dockerfiles are available under the GitHub https://github.com/sclorg[sclorg] organization.

== Image Location

Upstream Docker images, such as CentOS and Fedora base images and layered images based on these, should be publicly available on https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub].

For details on using the Docker Hub registry, see https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/[Docker User Guide].
