== Exposing Ports

Important ports should always be exposed using the +EXPOSE+ instruction in a Dockerfile. The +EXPOSE+ instruction declares the ports on which a container will listen for connections. You should specify ports your application commonly uses, for example the Dockerfile for an image containing MongoDB would use:

----
EXPOSE 27017
----

// For information on exposing ports in Software Collection images, see the xref:software_collections[Software Collections] chapter.
