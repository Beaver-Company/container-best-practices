This section describes the image naming standards for Docker images.

Docker URLs are similar to github repository names. Their structure is:

  REGISTRY:PORT/USER/REPO:TAG

The implicit default registry is `docker.io`. This means that relative URLs, such as `redhat/rhel` resolve to `docker.io/redhat/rhel`.
